    <h3> Hi! My name is Jhlechia Qureshi.</h3>
    <p class="intro"> Here's my story. I was originally born in Edmond, Oklahoma, but grew up an Air Force "brat" who did my share of getting around.
        Coincidentally, this made me a gypsy for a VERY long time with no clear direction in life. Probably seems strange for a child of
        a millitary guy to have no direction, but that's just the way the cookie crumbled. After a few countries, even more cities, and a
        lot of filler jobs, I realized that I needed something that would truly challenge me.  That's when I discovered a true gem (no pun intended)
        I discovered a programming language called Ruby that would prove to be the challenge I was looking for while simultaneously demystifying
        magic as a mere possibility in storybooks.  What I've learned from Ruby is that if you can learn to master the abstract concepts of programming
        languages, you are literally superhuman and resultedly capable of <strong>MAGIC</strong>.  Welcome to my journey.</p>
